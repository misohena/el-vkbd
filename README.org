#+TITLE: Emacs Virtual Keyboard

This Emacs Lisp library displays a virtual keyboard (also known as an on-screen keyboard or software keyboard) within Emacs.

* Screenshots

The following image is a screenshot of Emacs for Android (Native App).

[[file:./screenshot/android-screen.png]]

The keyboard displayed in the middle is the virtual keyboard created by this library.

Tapping the keyboard icon in the toolbar toggles the display of this virtual keyboard.

By the way, at the bottom is the flick input panel from ATOK, a Japanese IME app. While it's possible to switch to a full keyboard like Hacker's Keyboard, flick input is better for Japanese typing and switching between keyboards is cumbersome. So I created this library to display both simultaneously.

* Requirements

- Emacs 30.1 or later
- Graphics display environment

* Usage

Place the .el files of this library in a location on your load-path.

To display the virtual keyboard, load vkbd.el and type:

: M-x vkbd-open-global-keyboard

To add a button to toggle the keyboard to the toolbar, add the following code to your init.el:

#+begin_src elisp
(autoload 'vkbd-add-to-tool-bar "vkbd-tool-bar" nil t)
(vkbd-add-to-tool-bar)
#+end_src

Or simply type:

: M-x vkbd-add-to-tool-bar

* Layouts

The following keyboard layouts are provided as presets. You can also create new layouts.

** vkbd-layout-10x9

[[file:screenshot/layout-10x9.png]]

Limited to 10 columns wide, it can be comfortably operated even on vertically-oriented displays like smartphones. All ASCII symbols can be entered without shift.

** vkbd-layout-10x7

[[file:screenshot/layout-10x7.png]]

Based on vkbd-layout-10x9, reduced to 7 rows. Most symbols require shift to enter, but some can be entered without shift. Also, Ins and Del keys are omitted.

** vkbd-layout-11x7

[[file:screenshot/layout-11x7.png]]

Compact layout based on `vkbd-layout-10x7' with one additional column. Allows entering more symbols without shift while maintaining compactness.

** vkbd-layout-us

[[file:screenshot/layout-us.png]]

US keyboard-like layout. The width is wide, so it may not fit within the parent frame without size adjustment.

** vkbd-layout-jp

[[file:screenshot/layout-jp.png]]

Japanese keyboard-like layout. The width is wide, so it may not fit within the parent frame without size adjustment.

* Customization

M-x customize-group vkbd

** Customization Variables and Faces

Global keyboard settings:
- `vkbd-global-keyboard-options' : Settings applied only to the global keyboard (search for ~(plist-get options~ to find available options)

Frame settings:
- `vkbd-keyboard-frame-parameters' : Frame parameters (note that changes may not be immediately reflected due to frame reuse)
- `vkbd-recycle-frames' : Whether to pool and reuse frames (you can delete all pooled frames with M-x vkbd-delete-all-unused-frames)

Default layout & style:
- `vkbd-default-keyboard-layout' : Default layout
- `vkbd-default-keyboard-style' (currently only text01 style is available)

Text style settings:
- Variables:
  - `vkbd-text-key-width' : Key width (in characters)
  - `vkbd-text-column-separator-width' : Width of spacing between columns (horizontal spacing between keys)
  - `vkbd-text-row-separator-height' : Height of spacing between rows (vertical spacing between keys)
  - `vkbd-keyboard-buffer-line-spacing' : `line-spacing' value in keyboard buffers
- Faces
  - `vkbd-text-keyboard' : Entire keyboard
  - `vkbd-text-key-common' : Key area
  - `vkbd-text-key' : Normal key
  - `vkbd-text-key-pressed' : Pressed key
  - `vkbd-text-key-invisible' : Invisible key (used to adjust key positions)
  - `vkbd-text-column-separator' : Spacing between columns (horizontal)
  - `vkbd-text-row-separator' : Spacing between rows (vertical)
  - `vkbd-title-bar' : Entire title bar
  - `vkbd-close-button' : Close button
  - `vkbd-title-caption' : Title bar text

** How to Adjust Size

The easiest way is to adjust the :height attribute of the vkbd-text-keyboard face.

Another method might be to change the font parameter in vkbd-keyboard-frame-parameters.

* Using from Emacs Lisp

You can create multiple keyboards with arbitrary settings from Emacs Lisp using code like this:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq my-keyboard
      (vkbd-make-keyboard
       '(:title
         "My ABCD Keyboard"
         :layout ((?a ?b ?c ?d)
                  (?A ?B ?C ?D)))))

(vkbd-keyboard-live-p my-keyboard) ;; => t

(vkbd-delete-keyboard my-keyboard)
#+end_src
